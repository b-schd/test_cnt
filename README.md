The CNT uses the penn-cnt github organization to share publication-related code as well as internal tools and pipelines.  

## Teams
We use teams to organize members and repositories by lab. As a team member, you can associate repositories with your team, automatically add all team members as collaborators, and create subteams. 

## Adding a repository
1. There are two ways to add a repo: 
  * Create a new repository from the home page of the organization
  * Transfer ownership of an existing repository under Settings > Options of the repo that you own. You will still have admin privilages on the repository, but penn-cnt will become the owner (Note: the url for your repository will also change after the transfer). 
2. Associate your repo with your lab team and/or subteam
3. Add relevant topic keywords (e.g. "publication", "internal tool", "toolbox") to your repository by clicking the gear in the "About" section on the main page of your repo. 

## Usage Guidelines 

- At the minimum, penn-cnt should be used for publication-related code, but labs/teams can decide their own use cases. 
- Remember that you can use the public/private visibility option for repos that aren't yet ready for primetime
- External collaborators are welcome! Your repositories will function just as if they were under your ownership, so collaboration settings and privacy settings are still under your jurisdiction
